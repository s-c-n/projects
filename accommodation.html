                Where we stay ensures we keep our travellers firmly entrenched in a regionâ€™s people and culture, and provides them with unique local experiences that benefit the community too. In most locations, we stay in comfortable hotels, though on most of our trips we also get to stay a night or two in some pretty special feature stays on most trips.
